# Overview

In this project attempt was made to reproduce the paper "Benchmarking Deep Learning Architectures for Predicting Readmission to the ICU and Describing Patients-at-Risk".
Approach is to use various models to benchmark accuracy and precision.  Pyhealth library was utilized to do much of the implementation.
For further details please refer to the video presentation.
